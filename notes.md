##### Slide 0: Title

Hi I am Ben, I was very inspired by the rackel talk we had a few days ago, it was about life outside of the tech bubble and how we should take time to do other things then tech all the time.

- Hi I am Ben
- Raquel talk

##### Slide 1: Demo

So what my project does, let me show you.
Basically, you set up a goal, it could be something you want to do or something you want to be better at.

Them it will help you to do it every day!! by reminding you what activities you have to do for a specific day or even for the current month.

- Let me show
- Create a goal, something you want to do or be better
- See you month summary or your daily program

##### Slide 2: Why

It was my first project in Rails so I went into a lot of material and new concept so I would like to share with you what I learned. I have strong background with javascript so I will mostly compare rails with it.

- First projeect
- Lot of materials
- Javascript background

##### Slide 3: Cool in rails

Here are some cool things that I discovered in Rails. There are many others but that the 4 that I want to show you.

- Many cool things
- Selected there 4

##### Slide 4: Cmd line

Rails comes with a lot a command line to help you, you can create your project with the new command, and add controller or model to your project whenever you need. It looks like the yeoman generator in many ways. It is very convenient.

- Rails comes with integrated command line tools
- Looks like the yeoman generator

##### Slide 5: Model

The model management, in my point of view is one real advantages of rails. Every model is build to make serve an API. You can add a lot of validators to your models and rails handles everything itself. Is is amazing for the form validation for example. You can also declare your relationship between your models and rails will give you your  object linked to others. It is like having on ORM integrated. It is very cool although I wonder how it works when your model schema is really complex.

- Maybe coolest thing in rails
- API focused
- Many validators for forms
- Relationships
- Like having an ORM

##### Slide 6: Assets

Out of the box, rails provide what they called the assets pipeline. It concatenate/minify/uglify all of you assets for you. It is like having a grunt/gulp integrated form scratch and it works really well. It is very easy to add sass support to it if you want to.

- Out of the box
- concatenate/inify/uglify
- Sass friendly by default
- Like having grunt/gulp/whatever

##### Slide 7: gem

The gem packages manager works in some way like npm. You have a lot of already build features that you can add to your project. For example, I worked with devise which would be an equivalent of passport in npm, momentjs is the same, boostraps3 and others.

- Works like npm (add package to your project)
- Devise equivalent of passport
- Momentjs which is also available as a npm package

##### Slide 8: Conclusion

If you start a project with rails, you will have everything that you need inside mostly already integrated. Ruby seems to have really cool syntax and features, especially if you work with the dates for examples. And this project makes me use reveal.js, this very cool presentation tool which I always wanted to use, so it is cool.

Thanks you

- Rails provide many features out of the box
- Lot of things are already built-in and are ready to work
- Easier to start a project with it than any JavaSript

- Makes me use reveal.js to make this presentation
- I always wanted to use to which is really cool
- Thank you
